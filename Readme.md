# How to load items into the ASPxComboBox on a callback.


<p>In this example, the ASPxComboBox initially has one (default) item. When the drop-down button is clicked, and if items still aren't loaded, we perform a custom callback and add some items to an item collection. The given example differs from callback mode integrated into the ASPxComboBox, only in that in this example, the combo box initially has only one item, but not the whole item page.</p>
